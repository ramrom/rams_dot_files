# SSH auth
# can use GIT_SSH to specify a script that can run a custom ssh commmand
    # this ssh command could do something like use a different config file or a different identity file
# git 2.3.0+ supports a GIT_SSH_COMMAND env var to run the custom ssh command
- if you use ssh-agent, and load multiple keys, it will only try the first key, so only load the single proper key

# GITHUB AUTH
- TFA:
    - browser login requires the TFA
    - local cli, on a push/write to public repo or anything on private repo
        - git@ url repos: ssh keys dont require TFA
        - https:// url repos: can use personal api token as password
