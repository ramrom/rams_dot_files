TMUX:
- in copymode
    - space starts selection(or reset it), enter to end/copy it
    - esc cancels selection, still in copy mode

    - https://www.reddit.com/r/tmux/comments/7i9dd2/tmux_resizepane_sizes_are_wrong_after_updating_to/
- tmux set -u option   - will unset that option
- tmux set status-left "#(executable #{@foo})"
    - pass tmux var @foo as arg to executable

- tmux set -qg @foo "something"
    - so this is global to all sessions
