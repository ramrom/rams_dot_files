# KOTLIN
https://kotlinlang.org/

## FEATURES
- `sealed` keyword - inheritance of sealed classes and interfaces must be known at compile time, so in same package/module
- `interface` keyword - similar to java interface
    - cannot be instaniated directly, cannot contain state, can write default method implementations
- `?` after a type means variable can contain a null
- `data class` - primarily to hold data, very similar to scala `case class`
