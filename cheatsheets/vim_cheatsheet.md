## NEOVIM
- nvim-lua-guide: https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide
- sept2020 good video on why lua is great and a great choice for neovim: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP3J56sKtn0
- 2019 video on why nvim is awesome by core maintainer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt-vmPC_-Ho
- decent blog on vimscript and lua config: https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/tools/configuring-neovim-using-lua/
- plenary.nvim - a set of lua libs (uses coroutines via libuv) used by other neovim plugins
- coc.vim - supports vim and neovim, but it's beefy, mar2022 it's **DEPRECATED**, nvim-metals is successor
- neovim-lsp - neovim's built in lsp client, written in lua
- nvim-metals - full metals plugin that uses nvim's builtin lsp client
    - doesnt work with nnvim-lspconfig: https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/discussions/93
- nvim-lspconfig - a plugin with common client configs for langauges, CONFLICTS with nvim-metals
- nvim-dap - plugin to support debug adapter protocol
### LUA
- print a val: `:lua =foo.myvar`
- CONFIG STUFF
    - vimscript, sourcing lua code: `lua require('some-lua-code')`
    - source a vimscript file: `vim.cmd 'source ~/.config/nvim/keymaps.vim'`
    - o is general settings: `vim.o.background = 'light'`
    - use space as a the leader key: `vim.g.mapleader = ' '`
    - set a env var value: `vim.env.FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS = '--layout=reverse'`

### Tree-sitter (nvim)
- parses files by language and creates ASTs
    - can query AST: smarter syntax highlighting (better than vim's regex), better formatting(e.g. `=`), better folding, etc
    - parsing is restricted to just file, so LSPs will be way more accurate, but LSPs generally slower, treesitter is fast async c code
- good article on it https://teknologiumum.com/posts/introductory-to-treesitter
    - it links to this good watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jes3bD6P0To
