# PYTHON CHEATSHEET

## DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT
- it sucks: https://xkcd.com/1987/
- pipenv is successor to virtualenv and does more, uses Pipfile and Pipfile.lock
- pip uses requirements.txt
- virtualenv installs packages locally vs global system dirs

# breakpoints:
    ```python
    import pdb
    pdb.set_trace()
    ```
