# Rams Dot Files

My dot files for Unix-like environments and some scripts

## Vim

- neovim for better integration with coc and scala metals

### Plugins
- **FZF**
- CtrlP _(being phased out in favor of fzf)_
- coc (conqueror of completion)
- vim-airline
- NERDtree
- vim-commentary
- vim-fugitive
- vim-signify
- indentLine
- vim-tmux-focus-events (to help make autoreload better)
