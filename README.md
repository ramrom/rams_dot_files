# Rams Dot Files

My dot files for Unix-like environments and some scripts

## Vim
- Vim Plug for plugin manager
- neovim for better integration with coc and scala metals

### Plugins
- FZF
- CtrlP (being phased out in favor of fzf)
- coc (conqueror of completion)
- vim-airline
- NERDtree
- vim-commentary
- vim-fugitive
- vim-signify
- indentLine
- vim-tmux-focus-events (to help make autoreload better)
